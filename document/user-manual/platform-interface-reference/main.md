## Global Configuration

The Global Configuration component is a powerful tool within our app development platform that allows you to manage the global settings of your application. It serves as a centralized location where you can define and modify various configuration options that impact the behavior and appearance of your app.

With the Global Configuration component, you have the ability to customize the following settings.

![General Configuration](url-of-the-general-image)

### General

- **Package Name**: The name of the application which needs to be unique. This name can be used to set up iOS developer configuration.
- **Application Default Page**: Defines the first landing page when the application is opened or running.
- **Enable Auto Update**: 
    - **On**: Asks for automatic update when opening the application after upgrading the app version.
    - **Off**: Does not prompt for update and requires manual update.

### Android

![iOS Configuration](url-of-the-ios-image)

### iOS

To set up building iOS apps:
- **iOS Code Sign**: Common name of your Apple Developer Certificate.
- **iOS Team ID**: User ID of your Apple Developer Certificate.
- **iOS Provision File**: Upload the file directory of your Apple profile for the application.
- **iOS Private Key File**: Upload the file directory of your Apple Developer Certificate File.

![Third Party Configuration](url-of-the-third-party-image)

## Database
This feature provides a visual interface to external databases. Currently, eMOBIQ supports staging databases hosted on eMOBIQ servers and AWS DynamoDB for visual interfacing. Please note that these databases are considered external data sources and need to be configured through the Services layer before they can be utilized.

Additional Disclaimer: The eMOBIQ staging database is designed for lightweight testing purposes during app development and should not be relied upon for production-level features. We do not assume responsibility for any issues arising from the use of the eMOBIQ staging database.

## Build
The Build feature enables you to generate mobile app versions of your project based on the selected options in the build interface. This includes specifying the build mode (Debug/Development/Release), versioning, and cross-platform build options such as iOS and Android.

Before using the iOS and Android build options, make sure to configure the Android and iOS settings within the Global Configuration section.

## Download

## Save
Allows you to save the current state of your project. It is important that you remember to save your project to ensure no progress is lost.

## Preview
Preview enables users to visually preview their projects before proceeding with the build process. This valuable feature allows users to assess their app's layout and behavior during the development phase.

Previewing can be done in three ways:

Scan the QR code and preview on your own device.
Directly preview on the editor.
Open a www3 page to preview.
This functionality facilitates a seamless and efficient development process by providing users with immediate visual feedback on their app's appearance and functionality.
