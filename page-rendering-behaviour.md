# Page Rendering Behaviour

## Overview

Page rendering is a crucial aspect of visual presentation in mobile applications built using eMOBIQ no-code development platform. This documentation aims to explain the concept of page rendering in eMOBIQ in a simplified manner, accessible to non-programmers. Additionally, it provides a suggested illustration to aid in understanding the rendering process.

## Page Rendering in eMOBIQ

Page rendering in eMOBIQ refers to the process of organising and displaying the components of mobile app pages to users. Pages in eMOBIQ consist of various components, including buttons, text boxes, images, and more.

## Hierarchy of Components in eMOBIQ

Each page within eMOBIQ's app-building framework contains a hierarchy of components that defines their arrangement and relationship. Components in eMOBIQ can be visualised as individual elements or building blocks that contribute to the overall structure of the page. The hierarchy represents the organization of these components in a structured manner.

## Depth-First Rendering in eMOBIQ

eMOBIQ follows a depth-first rendering approach when rendering pages. This means that during the rendering process, eMOBIQ begins with the top-level component and progresses down the hierarchy, rendering each component encountered in a systematic manner.

To visualize the rendering sequence, expand all the components in the layer section of each page to view the entire hierarchy. The rendering process follows a top-to-bottom sequence in the fully expanded hierarchy within the layer section.

## Illustration

To aid in understanding the rendering process in eMOBIQ, let's consider the analogy of constructing a treehouse. Similar to how one starts from the base and builds upwards, eMOBIQ's rendering engine initiates rendering from the top-level component of the page hierarchy. It then proceeds to render each subsequent component in a hierarchical order until it reaches the lowest level component.\

Alternatively, envision a garden with interconnected plants and flowers. Starting from a central point, you follow a path that takes you to each plant, observing its characteristics and beauty before moving on to the next one. In the rendering process of eMOBIQ, the platform's engine "walks" through the component hierarchy, rendering each component and displaying its content before moving on to the next one.

## Conclusion

Understanding page rendering in eMOBIQ is essential for creating visually appealing and functional mobile applications. By comprehending the depth-first rendering approach and visualizing it through analogies such as constructing a treehouse or exploring a garden, users of eMOBIQ can grasp the concept more easily. This knowledge empowers individuals to design engaging and user-friendly mobile apps efficiently using the eMOBIQ no-code platform.
